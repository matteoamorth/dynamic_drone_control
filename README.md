# dynamic_drone_control
A matlab code to understand the dynamics of a drone

# Introduction

This project is focused on the analysis of the stability of a drone.
In particular, a system with reduced dynamics has been considered.

The nonlinear dynamical model of a multirotor UAV often used for control purposes is defined as:

$fhgg$

1. Controllability of the system
2. Design of a full-state static feedback controller
3. State space representation with perturbations
